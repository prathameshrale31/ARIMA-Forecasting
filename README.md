# ARIMA-Forecasting

ARIMA Forecasting of Solid Waste Generation at IIT Indore

This project aims to forecast the future solid waste generation at IIT Indore using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling techniques. By analyzing historical waste data, we can predict waste trends over the coming months or years, providing valuable insights for efficient waste management strategies. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and forecasting, offering a sustainable approach to managing waste on campus.
